# CS278 Text Messaging Application

  My project stems from a personal problem that I have continued to face during my time at Vanderbilt. For the majority of time at Vanderbilt, students eat their meals on campus and are restricted to the hours imposed by the different eateries. As a freshman, this was not a huge problem as most meals were eaten in the Commons Center where the hours were standardized and the center was open 7 nights a week. Yet as I moved to main campus, most of my meals were based upon which restaurants I was closest to. While I prioritized convenience over desired menu, I realized that often the places I wanted to eat were not open during the times I wanted to eat. This required me going into the Campus Dining app, looking through all the restaurants, figuring out which were still open, and then going there based on menu.
  My proposal involves creating a text-based application that solves the problem of students not knowing either the meal periods or the hours for on campus eateries. Students shall be able to specify the eatery of their choice to learn more about the hours for the day, or find out about hours for the week. This should have a similar interface and feel of the application crated in class with some added features. Example input could be “Grins hours today” with an output of “The hours for Grins today (October 1, 2018) are 7:30AM - 9:00PM.” Further students can check the meal periods at any time to get a breakdown of the different times. My final feature that might be a bit more difficult to implement would be a menu with the items being served on a particular day. This would involve pulling some data from the server or online Vanderbilt Dining webpage, but should be feasible. 
	As for my interviews, I targeted one sophomore, one junior, and one senior for a diversity of outlooks and thoughts. Based on the responses, it seems as though the campus menus are the most important for students followed by restaurant hours and then meal periods. I think having a simple interface and way of interacting and understanding the campus dining meals and schedule is an important part of one’s meal choice. By allowing for simple commands that can pull specific pieces of data from specified restaurants, the application is limited in scope yet covers some critical problems faced by current students.
